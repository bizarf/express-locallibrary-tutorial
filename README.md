# MDN Express Local Library Tutorial

A local library project created following the [tutorial on MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs). This project taught me how to use express generator, mongoose, routes, controllers, how to display the database data, working with forms, and deploying an express project.
